# War Card Game
Welcome to the War Card Game! This is a simple and intuitive card game developed using Swift and SwiftUI. It is a single-player game where you'll be playing against the CPU. The objective of the game is to win as many rounds as possible by having a better card than the CPU.

## How to Play
1. Launch the game on your iOS device.
2. Tap on the "Deal" button to start the game.
3. The code will automatically deal the cards to you and the CPU.
4. Compare your card with the CPU's card.
5. The player with the higher card wins the round and earns a point.

In the case of a tie, the round ends in a draw, and no points are awarded.
The game continues until all the cards have been played.
At the end of the game, the player with the most points is declared the winner.
